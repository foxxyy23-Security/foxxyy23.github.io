How would we use this?

2 main reasons

We want to get to another network on our host.
	the host is dual honned and we can get to the other network and see what is available

we want to access another protocol on the same device
	smb
	mysql
	ssh
any port that is listening on .0.0.0.0:<port> can be forwarded too
Plink
